1. To use IRINA translator, just type "make".
2. To use original IRINA translator in Refal-5 (which will be
much faster than IRINA) plese first configure
REFC and REFGO values in Makefile. Then just type "make wrap".

NB. Output of "wrap" program differs a little bit from "irina"'s output.
"Wrap" inserts an ugly newline after its work thanks to a bug (bug?) in
refc or refgo. It can be corrected if you change

# ifdef PCAT
	if (flags[0] != '\0')
# endif	
          putc ('\n', ferr);

to

# ifdef PCAT
	if (flags[0] != '\0')
# endif
	{	
          //putc ('\n', ferr);
        }

in "refaux.c" file (in refc/refgo sources, of course).
