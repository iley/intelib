InteLib is free software. 

The library part (the sexpress/, tools/, lisp/ and scheme/ directories,
and the refal/ directory, if it is shipped in this distribution)
is available under GNU Lesser General Public License, v.2.1. 

The files related to translators and interpreters (that is, these in the
interact/, ill/, ils/ and possibly irina/ directories) are covered with the
GNU General Public License (a.k.a. "strict GPL"), v.2.0. 

By default, two static library files are built, namely libintelib.a and
libintelib_interp.a.  The first contains modules covered with LGPL, and
the former consists of the "strictly GPLed" modules.  This means that if
you use the libintelib_interp.a library (e.g. if you build an interactive
interpreter into your application), you'll have to apply GPL to your
programs as well.  Please note that executables built along with InteLib
(ill, nill, ils, nils etc.) are covered with "strict GPL".

See the files docs/gnu_gpl2.txt and docs/gnu_lgpl21.txt for the official
texts of the respective licenses.

                             ------------------

Please note that Lesser General Public License does *N*O*T* allow using the
library in generic proprietary software; you need to follow some non-trivial
steps in order to comply with the license, including, but not limited to,
making the source code of the library available for your user and (!)
providing the user the ability to relink the whole project in case (s)he
decides to modify the library.
