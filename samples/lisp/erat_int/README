  This directory contains a simple program which finds prime numbers with
Eratosfen's algorythm.  The program is not so efficient; it is only a demo, 
remember. 

  This version of the program is intended to demonstrate the optional Lisp
Evaluation Interruption feature.  The program accepts two command line
parameters: maximal number to consider and the amount of time (in seconds)
which it is allowed to spend.

  The second demonstration goal is that this demo builds its own version
of InteLib to utilize non-default compile time options.  This feature is
disabled by default; use 

       make run LIBDIR=./lib_bin

to enable it back.  This doesn't make much sense now, however, because
the interruption support is now enabled in InteLib by default.

  You might want to take a look at ../eratosf/ directory instead of this
one if you don't need the Interruption feature.

  PLEASE NOTE the Makefile assumes you have already compiled and INSTALLED
InteLib.  If you didn't install it, use 'INTELIB=../../..' at your command
line, like this:

        make run INTELIB=../../..
