  This directory contains a simple program which finds prime numbers with
Eratosfen's algorythm.  The program is not so efficient; it is only a demo, 
remember. 

  The program itself resides in `prog.lsp' file.  You may need `go.lsp' file
in order to run the program with a Common Lisp interpreter (yes, it *is* 
possible).  The supplied Makefile assumes you have GNU CLISP interpreter
within your $PATH under the name 'clisp'.  You might want to edit the 
Makefile or give CLISP=/path/to/clisp if your CLISP name/path is different.  

  The file `prog.cpp' is a main file to compile with a C++ translator. 
Before doing so, you must translate the lisp code into C++/InteLib 
notation with the ILL translator.  See the Makefile for details.  Take a 
look at `prog.[ch]xx' files which are the result of the translation, but
don't ever edit them, since they're NOT a source code despite they look 
so human-readable.  The only right thing to edit is the source in file
`prog.lsp'.

  You might want to use the following commands:

% make lrun            # run the program using CLISP
% make run             # to compile it using ILL and run as a C++ program
% make run ILLDEBUG=yes 
                       # the same, with the built-in debugger assistant
# make clean           # to remove all the generated files


  PLEASE NOTE the Makefile assumes you have already compiled and INSTALLED
InteLib.  If you didn't install it, use 'INTELIB=../../..' at your command
line, like this:

        make run INTELIB=../../..
