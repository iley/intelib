This demo is just like the ``permut'' demo; please read ../permut/README
for its details.

The only difference is the technique used to create Lisp functions within
the C++ part of the program. Unlike ``permut'', where usual classes were
used just like in the InteLib's standard Lisp library, this one uses
UserLispFunctions which are effectively just functions, not classes.

Do 

    diff . ../permut

to see the difference.
