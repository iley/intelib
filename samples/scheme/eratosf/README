  This directory contains a simple program which finds prime numbers with
Eratosfen's algorythm.  The program is not so efficient; it is only a demo, 
remember. 

  The program itself resides in `eratosf.scm' file.

  The file `main.cpp' is a main file to compile with a C++ translator. 
Before doing so, you must translate the Scheme code into C++/InteLib 
notation with the ILS translator.  See the Makefile for details.  Take a 
look at `eratosf.[ch]xx' files which are the result of the translation, but
don't try editing them, since they're NOT a source code despite they look 
so human-readable.  The only right thing to edit is the source in file
`eratosf.scm'.

  You might want to use the following commands:

% make run             # to compile it using ILL and run as a C++ program
% make nrun            # to run the program using interactive interpreter
# make clean           # to remove all the generated files

  PLEASE NOTE the Makefile assumes you have already compiled and INSTALLED
InteLib.  If you didn't install it, use 'INTELIB=../../..' at your command
line, like this:

        make run INTELIB=../../..
