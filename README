              InteLib Library and accompanying software.

This is InteLib library vers. 0.6.21 development. 

It is not yet ready to be officially released, this package is just a
development snapshot. That is, I don't promise to keep the further
releases backwards compatible with this one, though I'll try to limit the
interface changes to a reasonable minimum. If it doesn't satisfy you, then
be patient and wait for an official release (1.0.0) which will be a
'supported' version, including backwards compatibility.

Please read the file COPYING for legal information.

The software comes 'as is', with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND; see
the file WARRANTY for some useful warnings :-)

See docs/readme.txt for more information about the library and its 
documentation.

The official web site of the library is http://www.intelib.org
Fresh versions are available at ftp://ftp.croco.net/intelib
