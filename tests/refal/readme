you need usual refc and refgo translators. Please read ../../irina/README,
configure REFC and REFGO values in ../../irina/Makefile
and type "make" here.
2. If you DON'T want to look how fast InteLib implementation of Refal is
and just want to run usual Refal tests (without t_time),
please type "make notime" here.
