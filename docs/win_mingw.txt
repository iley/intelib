*************************************************************************

1) Download and install MinGW compiler and MSYS (http://www.mingw.org).

2) Open MSYS-console and go to the intelib directory.

3) Type:

      make OSTYPE=MinGW-win

4) Type:

      make install OSTYPE=MinGW-win

This will install intelib into your virtual /usr/local/ dir of MSYS.

In order to use InteLib you must specify explicit search paths for
include and lib paths (for MSYS console they are -I/usr/local/include and
-L/usr/local/lib).  It is also recommended to add /usr/local/bin to
your PATH variable of MSYS.

If you don't want to use MSYS-console you have to specify real paths.
For example, if MSYS is installed in c:\MSYS, then the real iinclude path 
will be c:\MSYS\local\include.

Please read docs/build.txt for more details about building InteLib.
