RANDOM

(RANDOM <max>)


Returns a random integer number in the range [0...<max>-1]. This differs
from the Common Lisp RANDOM function in that it can not produce floating
point values; if <max> is a floating point number, the fraction part is
simply ignored. Behaviour is undefined for non-positive <max>.
