READFROMSTRING

(READFROMSTRING <string> [<eof-error-p> [<eof-value>]])

Reads an S-expression from the given <string>, which is mandatory.

<eof-error-p> (true by default) determines whether end-of-file should be
considered error. Specify NIL if you think it is a correct situation. If
you do so and the function encounters the end of file, it returns either a
special unique EOF value, or <eof-value>, if it is given.

NOTE: this function doesn't protect your program from syntax errors in the
given string, and therefore should be considered dangerous and deprecated.
Consider using SAFEREAD instead, which is capable of reading from both
strings and streams.
