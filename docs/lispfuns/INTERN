INTERN

(INTERN <name> <package>)

The function finds the symbol with the name <name> within the package
object given as the <package> argument. The symbol is created if it
didn't exist before. 

This function differs from the Common Lisp one in that the second
argument is mandatory. This is because there is no *package* variable
in Intelib Lisp.
