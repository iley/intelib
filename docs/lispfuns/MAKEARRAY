MAKEARRAY

(MAKEARRAY [<dimension>])

The function creates and returns a new array object. If <dimension> is
given and non-zero, the array of that many elements is created, and there
is no possibility to resize it. If the argument is zero or ommited, the
array of a dynamic length is created, that is, whenever you do AREF on it,
there will be no error and new elements are allocated whenever needed.

Unlike Common Lisp, there's no multidimensional arrays in InteLib Lisp as
for now. Also, there's no resizeable arrays in Common Lisp.
