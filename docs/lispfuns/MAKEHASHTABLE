MAKEHASHTABLE

(MAKEHASHTABLE [<ignored>])

The function creates and returns a new hash table. Unlike the
Common Lisp MAKE-HASH-TABLE, this version always creates a table
which uses EQUAL as the predicate to determine wether two keys 
match. The optional parameter is accepted for historical reasons, 
but is ignored.
