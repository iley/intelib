MAPARRAY

(MAPARRAY <function> <array>)


MAPARRAY operates on successive elements of the given array. The given 
<function> is applied to the 0th, 1st, 2nd, ..., last elements of the 
given <array>, which must be an object of the type SExpressionVector.

MAPARRAY returns the number of elements. Values returned by <function> are
silently ignored.

MAPARRAY accepts functional objects as well as symbols with associated
functions and lambda-lists as its first argument. It is not recommended
though to make use of this.
