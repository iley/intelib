DEFCONST

(DEFCONST symbol value [doc...])


Makes the given symbol to be a constant, that is, the symol will never 
change (except by another call of DEFCONST). 

Value is evaluated and assigned to the symbol, then the symbol is marked 
constant. 

Unlike Common Lisp, Intelib Lisp DEFCONST accepts an unlimited number of 
parameters, but all excepth the first two are completely and silently 
ignored.
