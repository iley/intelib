MAPCAR

(MAPCAR <function> list0 [list1 [list2...]])


MAPCAR operates on successive elements of the lists. First the
function is applied to the car of each list, then to the cadr of each
list, and so on. (Ideally all the lists are the same length; if not,
the iteration terminates when the shortest list runs out, and excess
elements in other lists are ignored.) The value returned is a list of 
the results of the successive calls to the function.

Unlike in Common Lisp, this version of MAPCAR accepts functional objects
as well as symbols with associated functions and lambda-lists as its
first argument. It is not recommended though to make use of this 
difference.
